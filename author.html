  <h1>About the Author:</h1>
  <p>Since he was young, Ahmed had always been fascinated by books, mostly because his parents got him into reading all
    kinds of them, fiction and non-fiction. Those included the great literary works of Tolkien and Rowling. That is what
    inspired him to create such a book series at 13 years old. Ahmed has no idea what influenced him to write with this
    idea in mind, but he let his fingers take over the keyboard. Before he could process it, he had created, in his
    eyes, a tiny masterpiece. No matter its size, he is proud of it.</p>
