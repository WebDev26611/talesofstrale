      <ul class="dropdown-display fade-in">
        <li>Elms: an Ilk of tree-men, as old as time.</li>
        <li>Chillers: an Ilk born from the Underland, a place of pure evil.</li>
        <li>Wizards: an Ilk who can control magic to its utmost extent.</li>
        <li>Men: an Ilk whose only abilities are courage, violence and pride, sometimes adding intellect to the mix.</li>
        <li>Cyborgs: an Ilk created to enhance the Men, but rebelled, now their own kind.</li>
        <li>Dars: an Ilk built of Ice, who died out in the Land, remaining in the Land beyond the Sea.</li>
        <li>Vorkan: an Ilk made of flame, the counterparts of the Dars. They never existed in the Land, and fought valiantly
          against the Dars in the Land beyond the Sea.</li>
        <li>Eldorin: the original inhabitants of Strale, not created by either the Aytar or the Saytar, who, upon the
          creation of the rest, hid in the Sea for fear of war.</li>

        <li>Lark: the main character, a Chiller who witnessed everything in his life go wrong.</li>
        <li>Rew: Lark's former best friend, now turned enemy. Will he be able to reforge the bond between them?</li>
        <li>Vey: Lark's most loyal subordinate. What is to come of her?</li>
        <li>Lardis: a most powerful Chiller, who was Lark's father, died fighting Elms Rew awoke.</li>

      <p class="dropdown fade-in">Lands</p>
      <ul class="dropdown-display fade-in">
        <li>The Underland: a place of pure evil, inhabited by the Aytar, those who created the Chillers. The Aytar are
          neutral in wars, but not the affairs of Races.</li>
        <li>The Sky: a place of fairness, inhabited by the Saytar, who created the rest of the Ilks. The Saytar are neutral
          in everything, unlike the Aytar.</li>
        <li>The Land: a place of balance between the Sky and the Underland, the board where the Ilks fight as pawns in the
          war between the Aytar and Saytar. A land of eventual peace.</li>
        <li>The Land beyond the Sea: a place of war, where only the Dars and Vorkan fight for control.</li>
        <li>The Shadow Realm: a realm possessed only by Chillers and Aytar, where a soul is tormented from entrance until
          the Realm-holder dies, or releases them.</li>
        <li>The Void: a realm possessed only by the Aytar, where what goes in does not come out.</li>
        <li>The Sea: a realm where the Eldorin hide, and where the Eldorin's control is strongest.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p class="dropdown fade-in">Lore</p>
      <ul class="dropdown-display fade-in">
        <li>The Great War: a war over the Dars' gold, which was yet to be claimed after they died out. Ending in a truce,
          each Ilk recieved a fair share of it, not accounting for the lives lost. No wars can be started over what happened
          in it, no matter what happened.</li>
        <li>The Ice: one of the four primodial forces, taking shape in the Land beyond the Sea.</li>
        <li>The Flame: the second of the four primodial forces, also taking shape in the Land beyond the Sea, the opposite
          of the Ice.</li>
        <li>The Void: the third of the four primodial forces, transformed into a place, governed only by the Aytar.</li>
        <li>The Sea: the last of the primodial forces. It has taken shape and created the Eldorin, interconnecting them
          both.</li>
        <li>The Dars and Vorkan: when Elms first arrived at the Land beyond the Sea, they split into two groups, and one
          discovered the Flame, and the other, the Ice. It transformed them. Those who found the Flame decided upon a
          leader, their King, to claim the most of it, and the rest got a small amount. Those who found the Ice gave each
          equal amounts, keeping the rest. Their most powerful are known as Keepers.</li>
        <li>General Lardis: a most powerful Chiller, the leading warrior in the Great War. He bore a powerful axe, known as
          the Bane of Elms.</li>
        <li>The Eldorin: an Ilk born from the Sea itself. The Eldorin are a part of the Sea and the Sea is a part of them.
        </li>
        <li>Aytar (the Silent One): Lardis. Lark's father became an Aytar after death. He quickly manipulated them and gained power over them, becoming their ruler.
        </li>
        <li>Wizards (the One): the next heir to the throne. Their first developing power is mind reading. Others include teleportation and direct contact with the Saytar. The One is the most powerful Wizard.
